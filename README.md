# WUH: WWE Universe Helper

This is a Tool I am attempting at making. Right now in WWE 2k23 (Well... any of them) Universe mode lacks a lot of stats and functionality. Something like Wins, Losses, Title Reigns, and Historical Stats not reseting leaving stock information that is irrelevant to your Universe.

It is hard to keep track of rivalries, what actions you did, matches they have won and belts they have lost. Wouldn't it be great if while you were editing your Divisions you could see what Weight Class the Wrestlers are without having to constantly back out into the Superstar List and view them.

Wouldn't it be great if you could list out every win or loss they had and with who? We can do that sort of, but its per show per selected day. Why not just search "Steve Austin Wins" and have a popualted table with all that information.

It can be annoying setting matches and not knowing the Power Ranking (Or rather "Tier" ranking) of the Wrestlers, same can be said for setting up Rivalries.

There is just a lot to be had and I can't find any Web Apps that can do this, that aren't paid, obscure or down-right malware. I don't expect this to be done any time soon as I am doing this while doing my Computer Science Program in College.
